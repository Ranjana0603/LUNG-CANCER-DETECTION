# LUNG-CANCER-DETECTION
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at detecting lung cancer from medical imaging data. The project utilizes deep learning models trained on a curated dataset of lung scans to predict the presence of cancerous nodules with high accuracy. Our goal is to contribute to early detection efforts.
